# Movie-Recommendation-System

A movie recommendation system using machine learning would typically involve the following steps:

1)Data Collection: Collecting data about movies and users' ratings of them.
2)Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for use in a machine learning model.
3)Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the data that can be used to train the model.
4)Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or matrix factorization to train the recommendation system model.
5)Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6)Deployment: Deploying the trained model to a web application to recommend movies to users.

There are many machine learning algorithms that can be used for movie recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning models.
we used content-based filtering.
In order to recommend movies to users, the recommendation system would take into account their past movie ratings and preferences, as well as the features of the movies themselves such as genre, actors, and plot summary.
